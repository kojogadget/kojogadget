# Hi! My name is Kjartan Gundersen :wave:

## About Me :information_source: 
I am a husband and father of one (soon to be two! :baby:), and a tech enthusiast passionate about programming! 

## Education :student:
I am currently finishing the last year of a masters degree as a teacher in mathematics. In addition I'm taking a bachelor in data science part time. 

## My Coding Journey :technologist: 
I started my journey of code with the book "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" in 2019. This book sparked an interest that still grows! Since then I have built a MagicMirror that hangs in our entrance, transitioned to a full-time Linux user, built websites and much more. Some of these projects can be found in my public repositories. After years of self learning I decided to get proof of my knowledge, but more importantly get in to a structured environment to learn the things I struggled to learn on my own. That's when I started my bachelor in data science. 

## What I'm Looking For :sunny:
I am now looking for opportunities as a **developer** where I can:
- Apply my skills to real-world problems.
- Continue learning and growing as a programmer.
- Contribute to meaningful projects and collaborate with like-minded individuals.
